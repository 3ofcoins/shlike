// Shell-like Configuration
//
// Why new format? Because there is no non-trivial, human-friendly
// configuration file format. JSON is insufficient. YAML is
// overcomplicated and its abstraction handling is just as
// insufficient. Another formats are obscure, idiosyncratic, as
// incomplete as JSON and little less overcomplicated than YAML. And
// Shell syntax and quoting rules is well known.
